# Care Your Hair (CYH)

## Introduction

CYH – Care Your Hair introduces a revolutionary paradigm in addressing the pervasive concern of hair fall utilizing the power of machine learning algorithms. In a world where personal well-being is intricately intertwined with appearance and self-confidence, the health of one’s hair takes centre stage. CYH, an acronym for Care Your Hair, aims to redefine the approach to hair care by offering a data-driven model that not only predicts the likelihood of hair fall but also empowers individuals with personalized insights for proactive management.

## Abstract

Hair fall is a prevalent concern affecting individuals worldwide, influenced by a myriad of factors ranging from genetic predisposition to lifestyle choices. This project proposes a machine learning (ML) approach to predict hair fall likelihood based on relevant features. The dataset encompasses diverse variables such as diet, hair care practices, stress levels, and genetic predisposition. Through rigorous data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training, our study employs classification algorithms including Decision Trees and Random Forests to ascertain the probability of hair fall occurrence. Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The interpretability of the model’s decisions is considered, shedding light on the key features influencing predictions. The deployment of the model allows for real-world predictions with continuous monitoring and updates to adapt to evolving hair fall patterns. This project contributes to the intersection of machine learning and healthcare, offering a valuable tool for individuals seeking personalized insights into their hair growth.

## Methodology

The CYH project employs a combination of classical machine learning algorithms and advanced techniques to address the multifaceted nature of hair health. The primary algorithms utilized include:
- **Decision Trees**: Fundamental due to their interpretability and capacity to handle both categorical and continuous data.
- **Random Forest**: Enhances predictive accuracy by leveraging an ensemble of Decision Trees.
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **Neural Networks**

## Model Building

The CYH methodology revolves around the critical stages of Model Training and Validation, representing the essence of the predictive modeling process within the context of hair health. These stages are foundational to the CYH project’s overarching goal of harnessing the power of machine learning to accurately predict and understand the intricate dynamics of hair fall.

## Model Training

One crucial aspect of Model Training is the partitioning of the historical dataset into two subsets: the training set and the validation set. The training set serves as the learning ground for the algorithms, exposing them to diverse scenarios and allowing them to adapt to the intricacies of hair health. Meanwhile, the validation set remains unseen during training, serving as a benchmark for assessing the model’s performance on new and unknown data.

## System Architecture

The System Architecture of CYH is a well-defined and intricately designed framework that underpins the platform’s functionality, scalability, and overall performance. At its core, CYH employs a Microservices Architecture, a modular approach where the application is composed of small, independent services, each responsible for specific functionalities. This architecture promotes flexibility, allowing for the independent development, deployment, and scaling of services.
